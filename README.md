# European-Options-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Monte Carlo simulate the European Options with the Black–Scholes–Merton model

Generate random number matrix from standard normal distribution
Use antithetic variates to reduce the memory usage

Use Black–Scholes–Merton model to simulate the payoff of the European options
